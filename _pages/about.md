Hi! This is Minxing Zhang, and I'm a second-year PhD student in [CISPA](https://cispa.de/en?_blank) under the supervision of Prof. [Michael Backes](https://cispa.de/en/about/director-page?_blank) and Dr. [Xiao Zhang](https://xiao-zhang.net/?_blank). My research interests are Security & Privacy, Trustworthy Machine Learning, and Model Behavior Explanation. I obtained my B.S. degree from Shandong University (2020) under the supervision of Dr. [Zhaochun Ren](https://renzhaochun.github.io/?_blank).
My CV is available [here](./CV.pdf?_blank).
